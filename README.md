_**TDR Smart Parking Project utilizing Facial Recognition & Servo motor.**_

Our objective was to develop a smart parking system by creating a smartphone app, integrating it with a Raspberry Pi, and employing Wi-Fi technology. The Raspberry Pi, operating on Debian Linux Buster OS (2022), was selected for its stability. This system's purpose is to inform users about the availability of parking spots within a controlled area, showing whether they are occupied or available. This functionality is achieved through infrared sensors installed in the flooring of each parking space. The system's facial recognition feature, which secures the parking lot against unauthorized access, is powered by OpenCV technology. It is deployed at the entrance to allow only authorized residents to park or reserve a spot. Moreover, the smartphone app communicates with the system using MQTT protocol over a hotspot connection. This setup not only controls the servo-operated gate but also enables users to monitor the parking status in real-time.
